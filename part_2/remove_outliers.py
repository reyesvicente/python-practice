# PROBLEM 15: Remove Outliers
# ============================================================================
# Write a function that removes numbers that are significantly different from the rest.
# Remove any number that is more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean.
# Hint: You may need to calculate mean and standard deviation.
# Example: remove_outliers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100]) should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
