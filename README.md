## How to Use

1. **Start with Problem 1** and work your way through in order (they generally increase in difficulty)

2. **Try solving each problem** without looking at solutions first. This is crucial for learning!

3. **Test your code** with the examples provided in each problem description

4. **Check your logic** by thinking through edge cases:
   - Empty inputs
   - Single elements
   - Large numbers
   - Special characters
   - Duplicate values

5. **Ask for help** if you get stuck:
   - Ask for a hint to guide your thinking
   - Ask someone to review your code
   - Look for similar problems online

## Tips for Problem-Solving

- **Read the problem carefully** - understand what input you receive and what output is expected
- **Start simple** - don't try to write perfect code immediately
- **Use print statements** - debug by printing intermediate values
- **Test with examples** - use the provided examples to verify your solution works
- **Think about edge cases** - what happens with empty lists, zero, negative numbers, etc.?
- **Refactor when done** - after it works, think about how to make it cleaner or more efficient
- **Consider time complexity** - as you progress, think about how efficient your solution is

## Difficulty Progression

**Beginner Level (Problems 1-7, 12):** Focus on basic syntax, loops, and string/list manipulation

**Intermediate Level (Problems 6, 8-10, 11, 13-14, 16-17, 19):** Introduce more complex logic, data structures, and algorithms

**Advanced Level (Problems 15, 18, 20):** Challenge yourself with complex algorithms, mathematical concepts, and multi-step problem-solving

## Solutions

Once you've attempted a problem, feel free to ask for:
- A complete solution with explanation
- Code review of your attempt
- Hints for getting unstuck
- Discussion of different approaches
- Time and space complexity analysis

## Next Steps

After completing these 20 problems, consider:
- Solving problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeWars
- Building small projects to apply these concepts
- Exploring more advanced topics like object-oriented programming and decorators
- Working with external libraries and APIs
- Learning about data structures like trees, graphs, and heaps
- Studying algorithm design patterns

Good luck! Happy coding! 🚀
