# PROBLEM 30: Word Ladder Length
# ============================================================================
# Write a function that finds the shortest sequence of words to transform from a start word to an end word.
# Each intermediate word must differ by exactly one letter from the previous word.
# All words must be from the provided word list.
# Example: word_ladder("hit", "cog", ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log", "cog"]) should return 5
#          (transformation: "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog")
# Example: word_ladder("hit", "cog", ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log"]) should return 0 (no solution)
