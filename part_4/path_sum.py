# PROBLEM 39: Path Sum
# ============================================================================
# Write a function that checks if a binary tree has a root-to-leaf path with a given sum.
# A path must go from root to a leaf (node with no children).
# Example: For a tree with root-to-leaf paths summing to 22, path_sum(root, 22) should return True

def path_sum(root, target_sum):
