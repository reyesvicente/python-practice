# Problem 5: Reverse a List (without using reverse())

Hey everyone! 👋

Today, we're tackling a fundamental problem: **Reversing a List** manually.

## The Problem

The goal is to write a function that reverses a list without using the built-in `reverse()` method or slicing with `[::-1]`. This is a great exercise to understand how list indexing works.

**Example:**
- `reverse_list([1, 2, 3, 4])` should return `[4, 3, 2, 1]`

## The Solution

Here is the Python implementation using a loop:

```python
def reverse_list(lst):
    """
    Reverses a list by iterating backwards.
    """
    reversed_list = []
    # Loop from the last index to 0
    for i in range(len(lst)-1, -1, -1):
        reversed_list.append(lst[i])

    return reversed_list

# Test case
print(reverse_list([1, 2, 3, 4]))
# Output: [4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## Code Breakdown

Let's walk through the code line by line:

1.  **`def reverse_list(lst):`**
    *   Defines a function named `reverse_list` that takes one parameter `lst` (a list).

2.  **`reversed_list = []`**
    *   Creates an empty list called `reversed_list` to store the reversed elements.

3.  **`for i in range(len(lst)-1, -1, -1):`**
    *   Starts a loop that will iterate from the last index of the list to the first (0).
    *   `len(lst)-1` is the starting index (last element).
    *   `-1` (the second argument) is the stopping index (stops before -1, so 0 is included).
    *   `-1` (The third argument) is the step (counts backwards).

4.  **`reversed_list.append(lst[i])`**
    *   For each iteration, it takes the element at index `i` from the original list and appends it to `reversed_list`.

5.  **`return reversed_list`**
    *   Returns the new list with elements in reverse order.

### Example Walkthrough with `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

1.  `i` starts at 3 (value 4), appends 4 to `reversed_list`.
2.  `i` becomes 2 (value 3), appends 3.
3.  `i` becomes 1 (value 2), appends 2.
4.  `i` becomes 0 (value 1), appends 1.
5.  Returns `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.
