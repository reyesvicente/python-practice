# Problem 2: Palindrome Checker

Hey everyone! 👋

Continuing with our coding challenges series! Today we're looking at a classic string manipulation problem: checking for palindromes.

## The Problem

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

**Examples:**
- "racecar" -> True
- "A man a plan a canal Panama" -> True
- "hello" -> False

## The Solution

Here is a clean Python solution that handles case insensitivity and ignores spaces:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    """
    Checks if a string is a palindrome.
    Ignores case and spaces.
    """
    s = str.lower(s)
    s = s.replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]

# Test cases
print(is_palindrome("wilabaliw"))
# Output: True
print(is_palindrome("A man a plan a canal Panama"))
# Output: True
```

## Code Breakdown

Let's break down how this works:

1.  **`s = str.lower(s)`**
    *   First, we convert the entire string to lowercase. This ensures that "Racecar" and "racecar" are treated as the same string.

2.  **`s = s.replace(" ", "")`**
    *   Next, we remove all spaces. This is important for phrases like "A man a plan..." where the spaces don't match up when reversed, but the letters do.

3.  **`return s == s[::-1]`**
    *   This is the Pythonic magic! `s[::-1]` creates a reversed copy of the string.
    *   We simply compare the cleaned original string with its reverse. If they are equal, it returns `True`; otherwise, `False`.

Short, sweet, and effective!
