# Problem 7: Factorial

Hey everyone! 👋

Today, we're tackling a classic mathematical problem: **Calculating the Factorial**.

## The Problem

The goal is to write a function that calculates the factorial of a number.
The factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

**Formula:** `n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1`
**Special Case:** `0! = 1`

**Example:**
- `factorial(5)` should return `120` (because `5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`)
- `factorial(0)` should return `1`

## The Solution

Here is the Python implementation using a loop:

```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculates the factorial of a number using a loop.
    """
    # Base case: 0! and 1! are both 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1
        # Loop from 2 up to n
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result

# Test cases
print(factorial(5))
# Output: 120
print(factorial(0))
# Output: 1
print(factorial(7))
# Output: 5040
```

## Code Breakdown

Let's walk through the code line by line:

1.  **`def factorial(n):`**
    *   Defines a function named `factorial` that takes one parameter `n` (the number to calculate the factorial for).

2.  **`if n == 0 or n == 1: return 1`**
    *   **Base case:** If `n` is `0` or `1`, we return `1` immediately.
    *   This is because `0!` is defined as `1`, and `1!` is obviously `1`.

3.  **`else: result = 1`**
    *   If `n` is greater than `1`, we initialize a variable `result` to `1`.
    *   `1` is the multiplicative identity (multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value), making it a safe starting point.

4.  **`for i in range(2, n + 1):`**
    *   We start a loop that iterates from `2` up to `n`.
    *   `range(2, n + 1)` generates numbers starting from `2` and stopping *before* `n + 1`, which means it includes `n`.

5.  **`result *= i`**
    *   In each iteration, we multiply the current `result` by the loop variable `i`.
    *   This accumulates the product (`1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n`).

6.  **`return result`**
    *   After the loop finishes, we return the final computed factorial value.

### Example Walkthrough with `factorial(5)`

Let's trace what happens when we call `factorial(5)`:

1.  **Check:** Is `5` equal to `0` or `1`? No.
2.  **Initialize:** `result` starts at `1`.
3.  **Loop:** `i` will take values `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`.
    *   **i = 2**: `result` = 1 * 2 = **2**
    *   **i = 3**: `result` = 2 * 3 = **6**
    *   **i = 4**: `result` = 6 * 4 = **24**
    *   **i = 5**: `result` = 24 * 5 = **120**
4.  **Return:** The loop ends, and the function returns `120`.
